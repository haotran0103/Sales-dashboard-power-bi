This project is a **Sales Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to visualize and analyze sales data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, profit margin, and product performance across different regions and customer segments. The goal is to help stakeholders quickly understand business performance and identify trends.
